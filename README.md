# CircleCI Orbs

The source code for orbs published by Ministry of Justice.

## What are orbs?

Orbs are packages of CircleCI configuration that can be shared across projects. Orbs allow you to make a single bundle of jobs, commands, and executors that can reference each other and can be imported into a CircleCI build configuration and invoked in their own namespace. Orbs are registered with CircleCI, with revisions expressed using the semver pattern.

You can find additional documentation detailing orbs, including how to use and create them, in [this repo](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/config-preview-sdk/tree/master/docs).

## Publishing Orbs

Orbs are added to the registry through the CircleCI API. The build in this repository (`.circleci/config.yml`) uses that API via the [CircleCI CLI](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-cli) to take the source of orbs located in the `src` folder and register them as orbs.
